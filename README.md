# Python Project Template

A template for quickly starting a Python project.

## Motivation

Setting up a Python environment can be time consuming and require the creation of many files. This template uses [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to automate this process, reducing the complexity of the initial configuration to the simple command `gmake init`.

## Requirements

This repository is designed to be used on macOS with zsh. Compatibility with other operating systems and shells is not guaranteed.
